## Introduction

The Snake Game is a classic arcade-style game where the player controls a snake that grows in length as it consumes food. This project is implemented in C# using Windows Forms and provides an engaging gaming experience.
I name this snake Snakerzaaa!

## Features

- **Classic Gameplay**: Experience the nostalgic gameplay of the classic Snake Game.

- **Multiple Game Modes**: Choose from two game modes - "No Wall" and "Wall" - to add an extra challenge to your gameplay.

- **Dynamic Food**: Enjoy dynamic food generation, including bonus food items for extra points.

- **Fun sound effect**: Enjoy hearing *bonk*  or Mr. Bean yelling his throats out when your Snakerzaaa hits the wall or bites himself.

- **High Score Tracking**: Compete with yourself to achieve the highest score and see your progress.

- **Snapshot Feature**: Capture a snapshot of your game and save it as a JPG image.

## Game Modes

- **No Wall**: In this mode, the snake can wrap around the screen edges. Be careful not to collide with yourself!

- **Wall**: In this mode, the game has walls around the screen, making it more challenging. Colliding with the walls or yourself results in a game over.

## Controls

- Use the arrow keys (Up, Down, Left, Right) to control the snake's direction.

## How to Play

1. Select a game mode from the dropdown menu - "No Wall" or "Wall."

2. Click the "Start" button to begin the game.

3. Use the arrow keys to navigate the snake and collect food items.

4. Eating food increases your score and snake length.

5. Avoid colliding with the walls (in "Wall" mode) or yourself.

6. Capture a snapshot of your game progress using the "Snap" button.

7. Try to achieve the highest score possible!

## High Score

Your high score is tracked and displayed on the screen. Challenge yourself to beat your previous high score and become the ultimate snake master!
